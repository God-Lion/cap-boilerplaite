## 2026-07-28 - [Secure jobId Generation]
**Vulnerability:** Weak PRNG `Math.random` used for `jobId` generation in `module-pipeline.service.ts`
**Learning:** It existed to generate a unique suffix but was not cryptographically secure, which could lead to ID predictability.
**Prevention:** Replaced with `crypto.randomUUID()`.
